  <h1>Pharmacy Sales Performance & Forecasting Analysis</h1>
</div>

GreenCross Pharmacy is a fictional multi-national pharmacy group operating across **Portugal, Spain, and Germany**, created to simulate a realistic European pharmaceutical retail environment.

Over a five-year period (2014-2019), the business generated **€127.6K in total revenue**, averaging **€25.5K per year**. Across the analysed timeframe, performance delivered an overall **+20.09% positive variation**, signalling structural growth despite annual volatility.

Revenue peaked in **2016 (€25.23K)** before declining to its lowest point in **2019 (€17.09K)** - a contraction that exposes operational sensitivity and the importance of demand-aligned inventory strategy.

Seasonality is not incidental - it is structural.
**January consistently emerges as the strongest month (€14K average)**, while **July represents the weakest (€8.8K average)**. Unlike traditional retail environments where Q4 dominates, GreenCross frequently sees **Q1 outperforming Q4**, indicating that demand is driven by health cycles rather than consumer spending seasons.

Portfolio concentration is equally revealing.
**Paracetamol alone accounts for 58% of total revenue**, creating both stability and risk. While its OTC nature, affordability, and broad treatment use justify its dominance, this level of dependency introduces exposure to pricing pressure, supply disruption, and margin compression.

Other therapeutic categories remain relatively balanced, contributing between **5–10% each**, with **Hypnotics & Sedatives representing just 1.15%**, reinforcing limited diversification depth.

Sales patterns remain consistent across all five years, confirming that these dynamics are not anomalies but structural behaviours embedded in the business model.

## Key Focus Areas

* **Revenue Sustainability & Growth Quality - Understanding whether revenue performance reflects structural growth or short-term fluctuations, and identifying the underlying drivers of financial stability across markets.**
* **Seasonality & Demand Behaviour - Analysing recurring consumption patterns to determine how demand shifts throughout the year and how operational planning should adapt accordingly.**
* **Product Portfolio Balance & Risk Exposure - Evaluating the concentration of sales across therapeutic categories to assess dependency risks, resilience, and long-term portfolio sustainability.**
* **Operational Efficiency & Sales Distribution - Assessing how sales distribute across time periods to support more efficient staffing, opening-hour optimization, and stock replenishment cycles.**
* **Inventory Optimization & Predictive Planning - Aligning historical demand behaviour with forward-looking forecasting models to ensure optimal stock levels, minimise waste, and protect revenue continuity.**

| ** 1. Revenue Growth & Peak Performance** | ** 2. Declining Phase & Volatility Control** |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Over a five-year period, GreenCross Pharmacy generated **€127.6K in total revenue**, averaging **€25.5K per year**, operating across Portugal, Spain, and Germany within a unified European healthcare market. | Following its operational peak in 2016 (€25.23K), revenue declined to **€17.09K in 2019**, marking the weakest year in the analysed period and highlighting exposure to demand normalization and strategic inventory adjustments. |
| **2016 stands as the strongest year (€25.23K)**, reflecting optimal alignment between demand cycles and stock positioning. | Despite the decline, the overall five-year variation remains positive at **+20.09%**, reinforcing structural resilience rather than systemic contraction. |
| Monthly performance peaks reached approximately **2.7K**, confirming scalable demand potential when supply strategy aligns with high-consumption periods. | Revenue troughs generally stabilized between **1.3K–1.4K**, indicating controlled volatility rather than erratic fluctuations, supporting predictable planning frameworks. |

---

| ** 3. Seasonality & Demand Cycles** | ** 4. Product Concentration & Revenue Structure** |
|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Sales behaviour is structurally seasonal, repeating consistent patterns across all five years analysed. | Portfolio concentration is significant, with **Paracetamol representing approximately 58% of total revenue**, establishing it as the core commercial driver of the business. |
| **January emerges as the strongest month (~€14K average)**, frequently outperforming Q4 expectations and demonstrating demand driven by health-related consumption cycles rather than traditional retail seasonality. | Secondary therapeutic categories contribute between **5–10% individually**, maintaining portfolio diversification while reinforcing dependence on a single dominant SKU. |
| **July is consistently the weakest month (~€8.8K average)**, suggesting reduced consumer activity during summer periods across all three operating countries. | **Hypnotics & Sedatives account for just 1.15% of revenue**, indicating limited strategic weight within the current product mix. |
| The persistence of these seasonal dynamics confirms embedded structural behaviour rather than isolated anomalies or short-term market shocks. | While Paracetamol’s dominance is commercially logical given OTC accessibility and broad applicability, this concentration introduces exposure to pricing pressure, supply chain disruption, and margin compression risk. |
