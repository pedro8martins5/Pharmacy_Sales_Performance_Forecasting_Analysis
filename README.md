# Executive Overview

GreenCross Pharmacy is a multinational retail pharmacy group operating across multiple European markets, serving over 250,000 recurring customers annually.

Between 2014 and 2019, the company experienced steady expansion driven by increasing demand for over-the-counter medication, respiratory treatments, and seasonal pharmaceutical products. However, leadership identified growing volatility in demand patterns, stock pressure during peak periods, and missed revenue opportunities linked to seasonality.
